# TestRail

While the (TestRail)[http://www.gurock.com/testrail/] Ruby client for their
V2 API _is_ available (on Github)[https://github.com/gurock/testrail-api],
it isn't available as a gem. Ain't nobody want to be copying and pasting API
clients into their projects.

And thus, zachpendleton/testrail was born. It's a gem wrapped around the
example Gurock client.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'testrail', git: 'git://github.com/zachpendleton/testrail.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Read more about Gurock's client over at (their repo)[https://github.com/gurock/testrail-api].
