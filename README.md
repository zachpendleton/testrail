# TestRail

While the [TestRail](http://www.gurock.com/testrail/) Ruby client for their
V2 API _is_ available [on Github](https://github.com/gurock/testrail-api),
it isn't available as a gem. Ain't nobody want to be copying and pasting API
clients into their projects.

And thus, zachpendleton/testrail was born. It's a gem wrapped around the
example Gurock client.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'testrail', git: 'git://github.com/zachpendleton/testrail.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Read more about Gurock's client over at [their repo](https://github.com/gurock/testrail-api).
